# Retrieves player data about a tournament on toornament.com and then gets these players' data from trackernetwork

# This would be nice but does not work since the repo lacks a setup.py and cannot be installed with pip:
# import "https://github.com/cubrink/Toornament.com-API"
# Instead it's included in this repo as a submodule
